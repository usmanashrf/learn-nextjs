# Functions

Before we use a function, we need to define it. The most common way to define a function in Solidity is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces.

### Syntax

The basic syntax is shown here.

    function function-name(parameter-list) scope returns() {

//statements
}
