# Learning Solidity Essentials

Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level programming language for implementing smart contracts. Solidity is highly influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and has been designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types programming language.

You can use Solidity to create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets
